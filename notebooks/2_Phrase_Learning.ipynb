    "\n",
    "This notebook is Part 2 of 6, in a series providing a step-by-step description of how to process and analyze the contents of a large collection of text documents in an unsupervised manner. Using Python packages and custom code examples, we have implemented the basic framework that combines key phrase learning and latent topic modeling as described in the paper entitled [\"Modeling Multiword Phrases with Constrained Phrases Tree for Improved Topic Modeling of Conversational Speech\"](http://people.csail.mit.edu/hazen/publications/Hazen-SLT-2012.pdf) which was originally presented in the 2012 IEEE Workshop on Spoken Language Technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the paper examines the use of the technology for analyzing human-to-human conversations, the techniques are quite general and can be applied to a wide range of natural language data including news stories, legal documents, research publications, social media forum discussions, customer feedback forms, product reviews, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2 of the series shows how to learn the most salient phrases present in a large collection of documents. These phrases can be treated as single compound word units in down-stream processes such as topic modeling."
